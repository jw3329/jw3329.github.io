Moim (formerly Tably) is an **event RSVP and management platform** I cofounded and lead as CTO. It makes hosting and attending events seamless — from registration to payments to community.

## My role

As **Cofounder & CTO**, I lead all technical decisions and a cross-functional team of five. I'm responsible for architecture, infrastructure, product development, and shipping.

## What Moim does

- **RSVP management** — streamlined event registration with direct-link flows
- **Guest tracking** — organizers see who's coming, manage capacity, and track attendance
- **Payment facilitation** — integrated Venmo payments with automatic RSVP status updates on payment
- **Social features** — event photos, comments, and community connections
- **Multi-auth** — Google Sign-In and Kakao login for fast onboarding

## Key achievements

- **50% server cost reduction** by consolidating production and staging into a single instance
- **50% faster RSVP process** through direct-link registration flow
- **90% authentication optimization** via Google Sign-In and Kakao, dramatically improving onboarding
- Built and shipped the full platform with **React (TypeScript)** frontend and **Python (FastAPI)** backend

## Impact

Moim is live at [mymoim.com](https://www.mymoim.com), actively serving event communities. The platform focuses on reducing friction in the RSVP process — from signup to payment — and helping organizers grow their events.
