A large, actively maintained collection of LeetCode solutions, focused on writing efficient, clean code for algorithmic challenges.

## Overview

- **200+ solutions** across multiple difficulty levels
- **Primary languages:** Python, C++, Java (with some TypeScript and Shell)
- **2 forks** from other developers using it as reference
- **Active since 2019**, with continued updates through 2025

## Topics covered

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Trees** | Binary tree construction, traversal, path problems |
| **Graphs** | BFS, DFS, connected components |
| **Dynamic Programming** | Subsequences, partition, optimization |
| **Arrays & Strings** | Sliding window, two pointers, prefix sums |
| **Concurrency** | Print FooBar alternately, multi-threaded patterns |
| **Math** | Number theory, modular arithmetic |

## Curated sets

Includes solutions from LeetCode's **Top Interview Questions** and **Top 100 Liked Questions** — the most commonly asked problems in technical interviews.

## Approach

Each solution focuses on optimal time and space complexity. Thought processes and approach notes are included alongside the code, making this useful as both a personal reference and a study resource for others.
