## Why Octave?

The course was designed around Octave/MATLAB to focus on the math behind each algorithm without the complexity of a full ML framework. Working through every assignment in the original language builds deep intuition for how gradient descent, backpropagation, SVMs, and collaborative filtering actually work under the hood.

This complements the [Python reimplementation](/projects/coursera-ml-python/) — together they show both theoretical depth and practical ML skills.
