Python reimplementation of the assignments from Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course — translating the original Octave exercises into a more practical, widely-used language.

## What's covered

| Week | Topic | Implementation |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **Week 1** | Linear Regression | Manual gradient descent, multivariate regression, scikit-learn comparison |
| **Week 2** | Advanced Regression | Extended assignments with real datasets |

## Three approaches per topic

Each assignment explores multiple implementation approaches:

1. **From scratch** — gradient descent coded manually with NumPy
2. **Multivariate** — extending to multiple features and feature scaling
3. **Library** — same problem solved with scikit-learn for comparison

## Why reimplement?

The official course uses Octave/MATLAB, but Python is the industry standard for ML. Translating these exercises proves understanding of both the math (cost functions, gradient descent, vectorization) and practical ML workflows. Each implementation is self-contained with included datasets for reproducibility.
