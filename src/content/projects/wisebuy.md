WiseBuy is a **luxury product price comparison platform** I founded and built, helping travelers save 10–40% on designer goods by comparing prices across countries in real time.

## My role

As **Founder & Lead Engineer**, I own the full product — business strategy, UX design, SEO, and all technical decisions. I lead a team of **three engineers and one UI/UX designer**.

## What WiseBuy does

- **Automatic currency conversion** showing true costs in your home currency
- **VAT/tax refund calculator** so shoppers know their actual savings after tourist refunds
- **Country-by-country breakdown** — France, Japan, Italy, UK, South Korea, and more
- **Brand scanner** — scan or search for specific products across all supported markets
- **Blog & shopping guide** — editorial content on how to maximize luxury savings abroad
- **15+ languages** — English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian, Thai, Dutch, Turkish, and more

## Key achievements
