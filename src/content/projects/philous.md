- **Heroku → AWS migration** — migrated the entire cloud infrastructure with CI/CD configuration changes, cutting costs by 70% and boosting performance by 50%
- **Team process improvement** — restructured development roles and workflows, reducing feature delivery time from 6 months to 1 month
- **Backend optimization** — reduced database calls and optimized queries, cutting end-to-end response time from 2 seconds to 0.5 seconds
