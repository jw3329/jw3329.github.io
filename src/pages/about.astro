    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The short version: I build things, break things, and make sure they stay running.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>
      I'm Junwon — a Full Stack and Backend Software Engineer based in Mountain View, California, with 6+ years
      of experience designing, developing, and deploying scalable applications. Currently a Member of Technical Staff at
      <strong>CurieTech AI</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before that, I spent 2.5 years at <strong>TikTok</strong> — first as a <strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong>
      overseeing 90% of TikTok's US payment system, then as a <strong>Software Engineer on the Risk team</strong>
      building fraud detection and chargeback systems. Before TikTok, I was at <strong>Homethrive</strong>
      building full-stack products in healthcare, and before that at <strong>Tata Consultancy Services</strong>
      where I started my career migrating enterprise data systems and leading a team of engineers.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the side, I'm <strong>Cofounder & CTO of <a href="/projects/tably/">Moim</a></strong> — an event RSVP
      and management platform — and <strong>Founder of <a href="/projects/wisebuy/">WiseBuy</a></strong>, a luxury
      price comparison platform used by shoppers worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
      I studied <strong>Mathematics and Computer Science</strong> at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC),
      graduating in 2018. The math background shapes how I think about systems — I tend to look for patterns, optimize for
      efficiency, and think in abstractions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, I build side projects (<a href="/projects/">see them here</a>), write about
      <a href="/writings/">things I'm learning</a>, and try to stay curious.
